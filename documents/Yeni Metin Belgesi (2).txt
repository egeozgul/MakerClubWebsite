TILTED DOG FOOD CONTAINER 
This project's aim is to hold dog food as well as water. It is handy because brings these two containers together and makes them easier to carry around. Its main purpose was actually finding a solution to a problem of long-eared-dogs's. Because their ears got into the container while eating, they were usually ending up with getting their ears dirty with the fat that the dog food contained. This meant nearly every time their owner needed to wipe their ears, which is not an easy task. After the idea of making the container tilted was heard, I came up with this design. It is a semi-sphere that has two hollows, one for water and the other for the dog food. While the dog is eating because of the tilt, the dog will drop his/her head and the sides will prevent the ears from getting in. Neither this project is printed yet, so the screenshots are only available.

ELEPHANT THE PHONE HOLDER
This project's aim is to hold phones, generally when the user is not available to do so. Could be used on occasions such as watching recipe videos while cooking, or eating, or just being lazy. It is a minimal design of an elephant that has its trunk held so it could hold phones in any sizes. 3D design program Onshape is used. The project is not printed yet so there is no real-life shot available. Besides, it could be used for any other purposes; such as winding headphones around it and some more. It is as limited as the user's imagination. This product is created while striving for a phone holder that actually could be used for other several purposes too.
