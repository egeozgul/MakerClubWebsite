            <h1>The King Fisher</h1>

			<h3>Built by Ege Özgül</h3>

            <p>This is a fully handmade wooden model boat. It is equipped with electronic recceiver and dc motor which make it a remote controlled model boat. It took  one and a half year to built it. </p>
                
            <br><br>
             <h3>Stages of the building process</h3>
            <img class=" cuteimg img-responsive thumbnail" src="M13_blueprint.jpg" alt="">
			<p>This is the original blueprint used.</p>

            <br>
            <img class=" cuteimg img-responsive thumbnail" src="M5.jpg" alt="">
			<img class=" cuteimg img-responsive thumbnail" src="M1.jpg" alt="">			
            <p>This is the wooden skeleton of the whole boat.</p>
            
            <br>
            <img class=" cuteimg img-responsive thumbnail" src="M2.jpg" alt="">
			<p>The Plnaking stage was quite hard since I used thick pine wood which was hard to bend.</p>
            
            <br>            
            <img class=" cuteimg img-responsive thumbnail" src="M3.jpg" alt="">
			<p>At this stage, half of the planking was done. But I had realized that the by only planking one side, the spine was bent to one side. So the whole boat was curved.</p>
            
            <img class=" cuteimg img-responsive thumbnail" src="M4.jpg" alt="">
			<p>To fix this curveture, I sliced the boat into three parts, and bened the boat back untill the spine was straight again, then reinforced the hull.</p>
            
            <img class=" cuteimg img-responsive thumbnail" src="M16.jpeg" alt="">
			<img class=" cuteimg img-responsive thumbnail" src="M14.jpeg" alt="">
			<p>Painted to white.</p>
            
            
            <img class=" cuteimg img-responsive thumbnail" src="M17.jpeg" alt="">
            <img class=" cuteimg img-responsive thumbnail" src="M11.jpg" alt="">
            <p>This is the dc motor.</p>
            
            <img class=" cuteimg img-responsive thumbnail" src="M10.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The rudder is connected to a servo motor. The shafts of the propeller and the rudder are piped to prevent water leaks.</p>
            
            <img class=" cuteimg img-responsive thumbnail" src="M12.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The accessories are printed in a 3d printed using ABS filament and then painted.</p>
                
            <img class=" cuteimg img-responsive thumbnail" src="M9.jpg" alt="">
			<p>The door has a function handle. The handle was made by soldering thick copper wires and sanding it. It was painted finally.</p>
            
            <img class=" cuteimg img-responsive thumbnail" src="M8.jpg" alt="">
            <p>A closer look at the 3d printed anchor. The lines were bought from an RC shop in Sweden.</p>
                
            <img class=" cuteimg img-responsive thumbnail" src="M7.jpg" alt="">
            <p>A 3d printed vinch. Althoght the vinch does not work, the lines were bought from an RC shop in Sweden.</p>
                
            <img class=" cuteimg img-responsive thumbnail" src="M12.jpg" alt="">
            <p> And thats it. It had a lot of fun while building this and have learned some practical skills.</p>
