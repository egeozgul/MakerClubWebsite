            <br><p> This is a 3D printed vertical pot that produces fertilizers from garden waste. It also has a semi-automatic watering system and an app programmed to make production of balanced fertilizers easier from 41 types of general food and garden wastes.</p>

            <p>Notice its smiling back face, was totally intentional:)</p>

            <br><p> The pot was originally designed during a 3D printing competition jam. During the competition, we had some time to come up with an inovative idea related with the topic given: sustainable agriculture and environmental applications.</p>

            <br><p>At first we did not have a solid idea. Then as we did some brainstorm, we had two ideas ,A machine that can even make spaghetti or chop food waste into pieces to help making fertilizers and a vertical garden with an automatic watering system.</p>

            <br><br><img class=" cuteimg img-responsive thumbnail" src="M3_Root.jpg" alt="">
            <br><p>We went on with the second choice, and it took around 3 hours to 3D design. At the end, using @Microsoft 's 3D Builder the root texture was applied on the pot.<p>

            <p>This anmiation -which was produced in Autodesk 3DsMax- explains how the pieces are assembled.</p>

            <p>This phone app was also build using Unity to allow the users choose the appropriate materials for making fertilizer.</p>

            <p>Finally we took the first place and won our second 3d printer. So, we decided to donate the second one to a public technical high-school where we gave a seminar about how to use the printer to the students.</p>
